# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
The most difficult part was doing part #2. It was hard because there were a lot of conditions to take into account along with the function itself being very complex.


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
Using match, find the words inside _ or % and then find the pattern within the input. Then use those words to search the database and return the information to the user.
